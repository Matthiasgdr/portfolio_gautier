## What's the point of this Portfolio ?

This site is using Html/Css/Js with Webpack for now.

It help me showing my work to the world! 
Soon, I'm planning to change alot of things and improving it by adding more animations and more projects. 
Using Vue.js or React.js to improve the portfolio code would be also very interesting.
